# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a sorting algorithm visualizer developed using C++ and ImGui with GLFW library. The user can select one of the following algorithms to visualize:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort (Not Implemented)
- Radix Sort (Not Implemented)

To run the project, navigate to the `src` folder and run the `make` command. This will generate a binary file in the `bin` folder located at the workspace root directory.
